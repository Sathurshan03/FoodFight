# FoodFight
This is a game that I created at the end of my grade 11 ICS course to demonstrate my learning to myself, and challenge my learning. 
The purpose was to make a game using all the components that I learned in that year. 
I have learned how to use arrays, loops, writing/reading files, and bubble sort.
This code is very inefficient since I did not know about ADT and OOP. 
However, I am posting this code to show my learning progress in programing over my career. 
To view my code, click on "FoodFight_SathurshanA", and then any file that ends with ".cs".
(Note: not including "Designer.cs" files)
